    <h2>Description:--</h2>
    <p>Biryani is a celebration of all that is great about Indian food – the heady aromas, 
    the vibrant colours, the fluffy rice and those addictive curry flavours. 
    Make this Chicken Biryani with your protein of choice – or try a vegetable biryani!
    One of the most requested recipes is finally here! Another RecipeTin Family effort, 
    it took us seven attempts to get this biryani right.
    Seven attempts means seven heated arguments about who would take the leftover biryani because somebody in the RecipeTin family, 
    at any point in time, usually declares themselves to be on a diet to address blog-related weight gain concerns.
    And it was worth it. (Belly and all.) Biryani, we can’t get enough of you!
    </p>

<div style="background-color:wheat;" id="ABOUT">
    <h3>About the Recipe:--</h3>
    <p>You’ll find variations of Biryani all across the Indian subcontinent. 
    There are 2 main types – one where the protein and/or vegetables are cooked mixed throughout the rice, 
    and the other version known as Hyderabad-style biryani in India where meat and rice are layered and 
    cook in a sealed pot over fire. The latter is the style of biryani I’m sharing today.

    There’s a wonderful Afghani restaurant in my area called Sahar (Newport, Sydney) which serves a Biryani that’s a 
    huge favourite among locals. Hands down, the best ethnic restaurant I know in the upper northern beaches.

    <h3 align="center">HOW TO MAKE BIRYANI</h3>
    <p>Chicken marinated in a spiced yoghurt is placed in a large pot, then layered with fried onions (cheeky easy sub below!), fresh coriander/cilantro, then par boiled lightly spiced rice.

        The crowning glory is to finish it off with a drizzle of saffron infused water to give it the signature patches of bright yellow rice, as well as ghee (or melted butter) for buttery richness.
        
        The pot is then covered and cooked over a low heat for about 25 minutes during which time the rice absorbs the aromas and flavours of the curry underneath, whilst still being beautifully fluffy.</p>

    <p><h2>Recipe Notes:</h2>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>Cut the chicken along the bone, keeping the bone in. So one half will have no bone, the other will have the bone.<li>
        Skin on bone in thighs is the safest to use (forms a protection barrier on base) and yields juicy chicken. Even if you overcook, worst case is crispy chicken skin which protects the flesh and rice. Next best is boneless chicken thighs.
        I take no responsibility for outcome if breast is used! But here is how I would do it: use whole breast, remove chicken from marinade, simmer marinade on low until it's almost like a paste. Squidge raw breast back in the "paste", then follow recipe starting with the onion and coriander layers. This will reduce the time the breast is cooking so keep it as juicy as possible
        <li>Garam Masala is an Indian spice mix and you'll find it in the spices aisle at every day supermarkets in Australia.</li>
        <li>Can be substituted with jasmine or long grain rice but be aware that the fragrance will be slightly different. Still super tasty!</li>
        <li>For an easy sub, use store bought crispy fried shallots or onions. The shallots are found in the Asian section of every day supermarkets and Asian stores (cheaper!). Get plenty! Use some in the biryani and lots for garnish!</li>
        <li>Saffron brings a unique flavour to the rice as well as the vibrant yellow colour. But it's not cheap! If you're budget doesn't extend to saffron threads, use the economical saffron powder which is not pure saffron. Mix 1/2 tsp powder with the water and proceed with recipe.</li>
        <li>Ghee is clarified butter, follow steps in my Movie Popcorn recipe to make ghee. Otherwise, you'll find it in the Indian section of some supermarkets (Coles, Harris Farms), or Asian stores. Otherwise, just use butter - not a deal killer here!</li>
        <li>Plain yoghurt is fine. Here's a quick Raita (Minted Yoghurt, pictured & in video): Mix 1 1/2 cups plain yoghurt with 1/3 cup finely chopped mint leaves with a good pinch of salt and a touch of water to loosen consistency if needed.</li>
        <li>Vegetable Biryani - Made it and loved it! Choose any vegetables you like. Suggestions: Capsicum, carrots, cauliflower, mushrooms, potato, zucchini, peas. Chop into pieces that will roughly be done at the same time when stewed, so that you have about 8 cups in total. Additionally, slice one onion.</li>
        Mix the marinade ingredients in a separate bowl, with the following changes: 3/4 cup of yoghurt; 300ml /1 1/4 cups water ; 1 tbsp garam marsala; 1 tbsp ground coriander; do not include vegetable oil in the marinade. Use all other spices per recipe.
        Saute the onion in 4 tbsp of vegetable or coconut oil. When starting to colour, add vegetables (except peas, if using) and marinade. Bring to a simmer and stew the vegetables until they are 50% cooked (softened but still firm), remove from heat. Stir in the frozen peas, if using. Continue with the remaining rice cooking, assembly and cooking steps as per main recipe.
        <li>Other proteins: Goat, lamb, beef, rabbit. Cut so the meat is jam packed and covers the base of the pot. Add water to marinade so meat is mostly covered, place lid on an simmer on medium low for as long as required so it's pretty tender. It might take 1 hour or longer, depending on what you use. When tender, remove lid and let the sauce reduce down to about 1 to 1 1/2 cups. Then proceed with recipe.</li>
        <h2>GENERAL COMMENTS:</h2>
        * Scaling recipe (click on servings and scale) - must scale pot size up/down
        * Salt - yes you really need 2 tbsp salt to par boil the rice. The rice will taste salty at this stage but the salt comes out of the rice during the second stage of cooking. Trust me, you need that much salt in the water!
        * Spiciness is mainly from cayenne, a bit from garam masala. So adjust to taste.
        * Fresh spices - use fresh spices, not ones that have been sitting around in your pantry for years!
        * Whole spices - the whole spices are typically left in the rice. They soften when cooked so to me it's not a big deal, I've never found it off-putting. If you're really concerned, either pick them out just before layering in the pot or wrap the spices in a small muslin or cheesecloth.
        <li>Storage - Leftovers keep well for 3 to 4 days in the fridge. Reheat in microwave. As rice is not quite as moist with leftovers, best to serve with yoghurt (even plain is fine). Even freezing should be fine, haven't tried it but rice and curry both freeze great so I see no reason why this wouldn't freeze well.
        Make Ahead - These are the things that can be done ahead: Par Boil the rice up up to 24 hours ahead of using. Marinate the chicken and cook it per recipe up to the point before rice covers it up to 2 days ahead. OR leave the marinated chicken in the freezer for up to 48 hours. Make saffron water and onion. Then on the day of, assemble the biryani layers and cook per recipe!</li></ol>
